# New Features
-Micro optimizations implemented for all data access
-Now caching the compiled version of lists (created through the plugin)
-Added forceFormat setting to override using cached versions of the compiled list


# Internval Changes
-Moved the AutoCompleteFunc to the jQuery.autoComplete namespace to expose it. Old jQuery.autoComplete object is just extended onto the new function

# Possible Breaks
-Removed bgiframe namespace creation (Makes a copy internally if it exists, or creates a blank function)
-Removed backwardsCompatibility flag and its components. Any scripts still using 4.1 will now break
