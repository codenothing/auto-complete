# New Features

-jQuery.autoComplete: object attached to the base jQuery object. Globalized defaults
and a few other methods outlined in the docs are contained in the autoComplete object.

-Paging and Scrolling on the drop list.

-Auto filling of input words.

-Removed timer dependency, and moved completely to event based tracking. It is
still somewhat of a hack as flags are attached to event objects, but will be
more accurate than using timeout/interval.

-The drop down list takes advantage of event delegation to track mouse events.




# New Settings

-ajaxCache: Boolean value to pass along with the ajax request,
prevents/enables browsers to cache requests made. Defaults to jQuery's native
settings
-autoFill: Completes and highlights the input with the rest of active list
item.
-maxHeight: A way to implement the max-height css property on the drop down
list through js.
-multiple: Allows for multiple word searches on the same input
-multipleSeparater: Separator for multiple words
-newList: Creates a new UL Drop Down list for each instance
-nonInput: Array of keyCodes not allowed to be searched with.
-striped: CSS Class to add to every other list item.




# New Callbacks

-onHide: Called when the drop down list is hidden.
-onLoad: Called after a list of entries is finalized, and before it's loaded
into the drop down list. Basically one last line to check the list before it's
loaded. If defined, it must return an array with the entries in the correct
format.
-onShow:  Called when the drop down list is shown.
-onSubmit: Called when the parent form wrapper of the input submission is
triggered. It only gets called if autoComplete deems it's ok to submit the form.
-spinner: Called when a spinner should be activated/deactivated.




# New Methods

-direct-supply: By passes list error checks and formatting. Data array
passed/stored in dataSupply must be formatted correctly.
-disable: Disables the autoComplete functionality, but doesn't destroy it.
-enable: Enables a previously disabled autoComplete functionality.
-option: Way to access/set single values to keys in the settings.
-search: Quick way to trigger a search with a custom string.

### Auto Complete 5.0 Changes

# keydown/keypress

Key triggers (such as enter and d-pad keys) are tracked through a keydown
event (keypress in opera) instead of a keyup, while input acceptable keys are
ran through a keyup event.



# event callbacks

Without the backwardsCompatible flag set, event callbacks are passed two
parameters, the event object that was initially triggered, and an ui object
containing key-value pairs needed. This change was made to conform to jQuery
ui callback standards, and to allow for future additions can just add to the
object, instead of more parameters.

With the backwardsComplatible flag set, the old parameters are passed, along
with the new ones defined on each function added as extra params.

Both versions of parameters are defined on each function within the docs.



# Document Event

A click event for each instance of autoComplete was added to the document to
track mouse-clicks and operate blur event's accordingly.



# Button Method Namespaces

The button.ajax and button.supply namespaces have been switched to button-ajax
and button-supply namespaces respectively. This was a flaw in logic on my
part, as jQuery doesn't support deep namespacing. A hook was added to replace
all '.' in namespaces to '-' to conform to the new methods.
