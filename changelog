# New Features

-All callbacks have the settings and cache object passed into them
-There is only a single event that gets bound to both the document and the drop down list. These event's get transferred to the input's in focus.
-Forms only have a single autoComplete event attached to them as well, with the event being transferred to the input in focus
-Filled in default nonInput array with shift, left arrow, and right arrow keys
-Moved all input data to an object stored on the 'autoComplete' data namespace.
-setting cacheLimit to -1 now removes any limitation on cache size.


# New Settings

-postFormat: Ability to format the post data object/string being sent server side
-formatSupply: Ability to format the supplied list, which overwrites the slower internal function.
-maxRequestsDeep: When true, blocks all requests, not just ajax calls, when maxRequests limit has been reached
-bgiframe: Object of settings to be passed into the bgiframe plugin.
-onListFormat: Event callback that when defined, must populate the drop down element. A list of possible values will be provided. This is
intended to overwrite the source population (which just loops through the list and makes an html frag to insert into the drop down element)


# jQuery.autoComplete

-version: Current autoComplete version
-blur: Global function to capture event when an autoComplete element loses focus.
-focus: Global function to capture event when an autoComplete element gains focus.
-jqStack: Now storing jQuery cached objects of autoComplete elements.
-keys: Object containing a list of keys used throughout the autoComplete plugin
-The getFocus and getPrevious methods can now take a single boolean argument to return jQuery cached object of the element desired.

/* Internal */
-arrayMethods: Custom methods that take an array as the first parameter
-handlerMethods: Defines methods that use triggerHandler method, and the maximum number of arguments allowed to use with it. When -1,
triggerHandler is used regardless of the number of arguments


# Possible Breakages

-jQuery.autoComplete.focus has been changed to a function handler instead of the current element in focus.
-Removed dataName setting, now based off global list cache
-The nonInput setting default is changed from undefined to an array fill with shift, left & right arrow key codes.
-All data associated with the input has been moved to an object stored on the 'autoComplete' data namespace.


# Known Bugs
-In versions of Opera before 10.01, using auto-fill puts the cursor at the start of the input, instead of at the end.
