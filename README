Auto Complete takes input from the user and runs a check through PHP to find what the user
is looking for. This test case runs a limited search on words that begin with the letter 'a'.

@selclass: Optional class for arrow up/down's, defaults to 'non-404'
@ajaxscript: Script name for ajax request, defaults to ajax.php
